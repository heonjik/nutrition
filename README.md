## Steps
1. Search for synonyms from NLTK.
2. Compare the word difficulty level from the trained BERT model.
3. Compare the text similarity using cosine similarity score.
4. (Optional) Compare the readability formulas such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Gunning Fog Index.
6. Create a visualization of the synonyms.
## Key Metrics
* Word difficulty level
* Cosine similarity score
* Readability formulas
  * Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
  * Gunning Fog Index
* Word frequency
